There are two tables in picvoice.db
a) annotiations
unique_id,user_id,image_filename,mp3_filename,created_at         

b) user
unique_id,email,created_at    


----------------

Can we make the following changes:
1. In the annotations table, the fields currently are :
unique_id,user_id,image_filename,mp3_filename,created_at

Instead of duplicating a new image for every voice annotation, when
the mp3 is recorded, just enter a new entry in the annotations table
with the current file name. Do not duplicate the image file.

2. In the management display, for each image, just indicate the total
number of annotations. This may require a sum for the image in question

Clicking the image thumbnail, should bring you to the detail page
with the larger image, and a list of annotations. For each annotation
have a play, delete, download small buttons.

---------

There are some problems with the current code.
Lets simplify the process flow of uploading a folder of images

a) Upload into temp
b) create a unique filename for the images and put into uploads
c) clean up temp

Currently it  every time"press to record" is clicked in the primary interface a duplicate of the image is made with a unique filename, and this new filename with the recorded mp3 is entered into the annotations table.
Please modify the code so that no duplicate image with unique filename is made when
"press to record" is clicked. Instead create the mp3 and the image filename and mp3 are entered into the annotations databaee.

----------

To simplify matters for elderly users,  in the primary
interface, when a folder of images is uploaded, only those can be annotated, not
previous uploads.

There may be a few ways to accomplish this:
a) Add an image table, with the upload time, perhaps a tag for last-upload and only
those are displayed in the primary interface.
or
b) Modify the process flow for uploading folders
   i) When a user selects  a new folder to upload, the temp folder is cleared
   ii) Upload new images into temp folder with modified filenames to ensure no conflict.
   iii) Copy these images into uploads folder
   iv) Have the primary interface display images in the temp folder but for every annotation use the path of the corresponding image in the uploads folder.

or

something else ?


Please help suggest approaches, pro and cons .

UI Design:

The management screen does not have to be fully elderly
friendly whereas the index.html should continue to be elderly friendly.

Ready flag:
Adding a concept of Ready to annotate perhaps by using a ready flag in the the
database. Please suggest if there is a more elegant method of doing this.
The Ready to annotate allows the management interface to set which images
will be reviewed by the elderly. 

When an image is uploaded through the simple annotation interface (index.html)
the images are marked as Ready=1. If uploaded into management interface, they are marked Ready=0. The set of images that are displayed  in the simple annotation
interface should be all images that are Ready=1 plus all images from the last upload session.  

Management interface: Allow filtering of images by last upload session, Ready state in addition to the current filtering.
ALso add a way to select a set of images and set the Ready flag.

Refinement:

I would like to refine the uploading process:
1. when  images are uploaded  in management page, set ready=0
2. when  images are uploaded from simple annotation page (index.html)
please set ready=1 
3. Only display images that are ready=1 in the simple annotation page. Remove
logic that also included images from the last upload session. 

Refinement2:
There are two upload buttons in the management screen.
One labelled "Upload New Images" and the other labelled "Upload Images".
1) "Upload Images" is a image file selector and
2) "Upload New Images" uploads folders.
Is it possible to consolidate the file and image selector into one ?
If not just keep the "Upload Images" button.
When images are uploaded in management interface, set ready=0

Remove (2) "Upload New Images"  in management page

Tags:

I am intereted in adding a tagging mechanism for images.
Could this be used to implement albums and favourite images as well ?

The management interface should also support setting a set of images with user
defined tags. A way to manage tags as well. 

The images can be favourited/unfavorited  with a star on the management page.

Albums:

An image can belong to multiple albums or none. Please suggest if the best
way to achieve this is by using tags or a seperate album structure 

Viewing of All images OR from an Album in the management screen.

In the management screen, please add support for selecting a set of images into
an album.


Filtering:

The filter on the management page should allow selection of
favourites,
annotated, not annotated
last session,
ready state,
within an album or all images


Before proceeding, please share with me options as well as alternatives to what i have proposed.
